The core of this project is completed you can automatically add steam games to the DB and manually add other games.
There will be progression to allow for more automation in terms of digitally owned game like Uplay, EA, Xbox, Playstation, etc.

## Goal
The goal of this project is to allow people to keep track of the games they own both physically and digitally in a database.
The current plan is to automate the process of adding digital steam games and possibly add a way to automate adding digital games from platforms like Playstation, Xbox, Orgins, Uplay, epic, etc.
In the event I finish this project I plan on making add ons that will use the database created from this project some idea would be random game selector, a GUI interface to view what you have and possible add games from there, and other things I think of.
If you would like to contribute to this project feel free to modify the code and make a pull request all help is appreciated
