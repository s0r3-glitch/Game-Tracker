## Goal
The goal of this project is to allow people to keep track of the games they own both physically and digitally in a database.
The current plan is to automate the process of adding digital steam games and possibly add a way to automate adding digital games from platforms like Playstation, Xbox, Orgins, Uplay, epic, etc.
In the event I finish this project I plan on making add ons that will use the database created from this project some idea would be random game selector, a GUI interface to view what you have and possible add games from there, and other things I think of.
